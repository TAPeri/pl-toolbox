## DESCRIPTION
The Preference Learning Toolbox aims at providing a user-friendly application to build prediction models from ordinal data. The basic steps of data preprocessing, automatic feature selection and modelling are supported through a graphical-user interface.

All the methods for modelling belong to the family of preference learning algorithms which are designed to infer models from ordinal data in the form of ranks, ratings or comparisons.


## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The tool is built on Java and utilises JavaFX for the GUI. Consecuently, the tool runs on systems with Java SE 7u13 or later.


## BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
The code uses the google-gson library. When compiling the code, use plt.Main as the main class.


## LICENSE
The Preference Learning Toolbox is shared under the GNU GPL license.


## CREDITS
The core of the tool was developed by Luca Querella, Vincent E. Farrugia, Héctor P. Martínez and Georgios N. Yannakakis, working at the IT University of Copenhagen and the University of Malta.
